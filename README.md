## Flipper

Flip the tiles to find pairs. Find al the pairs and win the game!

Flipper is a little ReactJS practice project, loosely inspires by the Naughts and Crosses tutorial on Reactjs.org

The tiles are rendered with SVG, created using React. Each game produces a random and unique tileset.

The app is responsive to screen size and orientation.
